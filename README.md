# Proceso-de-Selecci-n-Challenge

In this repository, theres the solutions for the tasks given to me in the code challenge. Thank you for your consideration.

In order to run task1.py, we need to have the library "Selenium" installed. This is done by running the command "pip install selenium" in the terminal. You can find more help in: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_library/
For task2.py, you need to install the "requests" libray and the "jsonschema" library. Both can be done by terminal commands: "pip install requests", "pip install jsonschema". You can find more help in: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install/ and in https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
